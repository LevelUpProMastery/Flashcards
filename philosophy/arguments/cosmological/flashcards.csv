What does 'a posteriori' mean?,Knowledge based on observation and experience rather than reason alone.
Who developed the Cosmological Argument?,It was developed by Thomas Aquinas and earlier by Aristotle.
What is Aquinas’ First Way?,The argument from motion: everything in motion is moved by something else so there must be a first unmoved mover.
What is Aquinas’ Second Way?,The argument from causation: every effect has a cause so there must be a first uncaused cause.
What is Aquinas’ Third Way?,The argument from contingency: contingent beings depend on a necessary being for existence.
What is an infinite regress?,An endless chain of causes with no first cause.
Why does Aquinas reject infinite regress?,Because without a first cause there would be no subsequent causes.
What is meant by a necessary being?,A being that must exist and cannot fail to exist.
Why is the Cosmological Argument inductive?,Because it draws a probable conclusion based on observation not logical certainty.
One strength of the Cosmological Argument?,It is based on empirical evidence and common human experience.
One weakness of the Cosmological Argument?,It assumes everything must have a cause which may not apply to the universe.
What is the Kalam Cosmological Argument?,A modern version arguing the universe began to exist and therefore has a cause.
Who developed the Kalam Cosmological Argument?,It was developed by Al-Ghazali and later William Lane Craig.
How does science challenge the Cosmological Argument?,Quantum physics suggests some events may be uncaused.
Does the Cosmological Argument prove the God of classical theism?,No it does not prove that the first cause has the attributes of the Christian God.
