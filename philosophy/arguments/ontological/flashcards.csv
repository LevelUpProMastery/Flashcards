What is the Ontological Argument?,An a priori argument that claims God must exist based on the definition or concept of God.
What does a priori mean?,Knowledge gained through reason rather than observation or experience.
Who first proposed the Ontological Argument?,Anselm of Canterbury.
How does Anselm define God?,God is defined as that than which nothing greater can be conceived.
Where does the Ontological Argument say God exists first?,In the mind as an idea or concept.
Why is existence in reality greater than existence in the mind?,Because something that exists in reality is greater than something that exists only as an idea.
What is Anselm's key conclusion?,God must exist in reality as well as in the mind.
What type of argument is the Ontological Argument?,A deductive argument.
What does deductive mean?,If the premises are true then the conclusion must be true.
What is Gaunilo's criticism of Anselm?,He argues that the logic could prove the existence of a perfect island.
What is the perfect island criticism?,If Anselm's logic worked then a perfect island would have to exist which seems absurd.
How did Anselm respond to Gaunilo?,He argued that the Ontological Argument only applies to a necessary being like God.
What is a necessary being?,A being that must exist and cannot fail to exist.
What is a contingent being?,A being that depends on something else for its existence.
What was Descartes' version of the Ontological Argument?,He argued that existence is a necessary part of God's essence.
How did Descartes compare God to a triangle?,Just as a triangle must have three sides God must have existence.
What was Kant's main criticism?,He argued that existence is not a predicate.
What does Kant mean by existence is not a predicate?,Existence does not add a property to something.
Why is Kant's criticism significant?,It challenges the idea that existence makes something greater.
One strength of the Ontological Argument?,If the logic is accepted the conclusion is unavoidable.
One weakness of the Ontological Argument?,It relies heavily on accepting a specific definition of God.
