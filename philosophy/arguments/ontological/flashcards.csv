What is the Ontological Argument?,An a priori argument that claims God must exist based on the concept or definition of God rather than observation.
What does a priori mean?,Knowledge gained through reason alone rather than experience of the world.
Who first proposed the Ontological Argument?,Anselm of Canterbury.
How does Anselm define God?,God is defined as that than which nothing greater can be conceived.
Outline Anselm’s Ontological Argument,God exists in the mind. Existence in reality is greater than existence in the mind alone. Therefore God must exist in reality.
What is reductio ad absurdum?,A form of argument showing a claim leads to a contradiction and must therefore be false.
Why does Anselm use reductio ad absurdum?,To show that denying God’s existence leads to a contradiction.
What is Gaunilo’s criticism of Anselm?,The perfect island objection says Anselm’s logic could be used to prove anything exists.
What is Anselm’s response to Gaunilo?,Anselm argues the argument applies only to a necessary being like God and not to contingent things like islands.
What is a necessary being?,A being that must exist and cannot fail to exist.
What is a contingent being?,A being that depends on something else for its existence and could fail to exist.
How does Descartes develop the Ontological Argument?,God’s existence is inseparable from God’s essence like three sides are inseparable from a triangle.
What does Kant mean by existence is not a predicate?,Existence does not add a property or quality to a concept.
Why does Kant reject the Ontological Argument?,Because existence does not make something greater and cannot be treated as a defining property.
One strength of the Ontological Argument,If existence is accepted as a predicate then the logic follows.
One weakness of the Ontological Argument,Many reject the idea that existence is a property.
Overall evaluation of the Ontological Argument,The argument is logically interesting but relies on controversial assumptions about existence.
