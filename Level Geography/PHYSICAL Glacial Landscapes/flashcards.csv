What is a glacier?,A mass of ice formed from compacted snow that moves under gravity.
What is glaciation?,The process of land being covered or shaped by glaciers.
What is an ice sheet?,A large mass of ice covering more than 50000 km².
What is an ice cap?,A smaller dome-shaped mass of ice covering highland areas.
What is a valley glacier?,A glacier confined within a mountain valley.
What is accumulation?,The gain of ice through snowfall.
What is ablation?,The loss of ice through melting sublimation or calving.
What is the equilibrium line?,The boundary between accumulation and ablation zones.
What is glacial movement?,The downhill flow of ice due to gravity.
What is internal deformation?,Ice movement caused by pressure within the glacier.
What is basal sliding?,Glacier sliding over bedrock due to meltwater lubrication.
What is plucking?,Erosion where ice freezes onto rock and pulls it away.
What is abrasion?,Erosion caused by rocks embedded in ice scraping the bedrock.
What is freeze-thaw weathering?,Water freezes in cracks expands and breaks rock apart.
What is a corrie?,A bowl-shaped hollow formed by glacial erosion.
What is an arête?,A sharp ridge formed between two corries.
What is a pyramidal peak?,A pointed mountain formed by three or more corries.
What is a U-shaped valley?,A wide flat-bottomed valley carved by glaciers.
What is a hanging valley?,A smaller valley left above the main glacial valley.
What is a ribbon lake?,A long narrow lake formed in an over-deepened valley.
What is a roche moutonnée?,A rock feature shaped by abrasion and plucking.
What is a moraine?,Accumulation of debris deposited by a glacier.
What is a lateral moraine?,Debris deposited along the sides of a glacier.
What is a medial moraine?,Debris formed where two glaciers meet.
What is a terminal moraine?,Ridge of debris marking the furthest advance of a glacier.
What is a ground moraine?,Unsorted debris left beneath a glacier.
What is till?,Unsorted sediment deposited directly by ice.
What is a drumlin?,A streamlined hill formed from glacial till.
What is an erratic?,A large rock transported and deposited by glacial ice.
What is an outwash plain?,A flat area formed by meltwater deposits.
What is a kettle hole?,A depression formed by melting ice blocks.
What is a fjord?,A deep U-shaped valley flooded by the sea.
What is periglacial?,Processes occurring around glaciers.
What is permafrost?,Permanently frozen ground.
What is solifluction?,Slow movement of saturated soil over permafrost.
What is patterned ground?,Geometric patterns formed by freeze-thaw action.
What is frost heave?,Upward movement of soil due to ice formation.
What is glacial retreat?,When a glacier shrinks due to increased ablation.
What is glacial advance?,When accumulation exceeds ablation and glacier grows.
How does climate change affect glaciers?,Causes retreat and sea level rise.
What is isostatic rebound?,Land rising after ice weight is removed.
What is eustatic sea level change?,Global change in sea level due to melting ice.
Why are glacial landscapes popular for tourism?,Scenic beauty skiing and outdoor activities.
