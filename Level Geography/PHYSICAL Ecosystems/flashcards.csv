What is an ecosystem?,A community of living organisms interacting with their physical environment.
What are biotic components?,Living elements such as plants and animals.
What are abiotic components?,Non-living elements such as climate soil and water.
What is a biome?,A large-scale ecosystem defined by climate and vegetation.
What determines global biome distribution?,Climate particularly temperature and precipitation.
What is a food chain?,A linear sequence showing energy transfer between organisms.
What is a food web?,A network of interconnected food chains.
What is a trophic level?,A feeding position in a food chain.
What are producers?,Organisms that make their own food through photosynthesis.
What are consumers?,Organisms that feed on other organisms.
What are decomposers?,Organisms that break down dead organic matter.
What is energy flow in ecosystems?,Movement of energy from the sun through trophic levels.
Why does energy decrease up trophic levels?,Energy is lost as heat through respiration.
What is a nutrient cycle?,The movement of nutrients between living and non-living components.
What are the main nutrient stores?,Biomass litter and soil.
What is biomass?,Total mass of living organisms in an area.
What is litter?,Dead plant material on the ground.
What is soil store?,Nutrients stored in soil.
What is primary succession?,Colonisation of newly exposed land without soil.
What is secondary succession?,Recovery of vegetation after disturbance.
What is a pioneer species?,First species to colonise bare land.
What is a climax community?,Stable mature ecosystem at end of succession.
What is a tropical rainforest biome?,Hot wet ecosystem with high biodiversity.
What are characteristics of tropical rainforests?,High rainfall layered vegetation and rapid nutrient cycling.
Why are rainforest soils often infertile?,Heavy rainfall leaches nutrients.
What is deforestation?,Removal of forest cover.
How does deforestation affect nutrient cycling?,Reduces biomass store and increases soil erosion.
What is a temperate deciduous forest?,Biome with moderate climate and seasonal leaf loss.
What is biodiversity?,The variety of plant and animal life.
Why is biodiversity important?,Increases ecosystem stability and resilience.
What is resilience?,Ability of ecosystem to recover from disturbance.
What is sustainable management?,Using resources without degrading ecosystems.
What is a desert biome?,Hot dry ecosystem with low rainfall.
How do desert plants adapt?,Deep roots small leaves and water storage.
What is a tundra biome?,Cold ecosystem with permafrost.
What is permafrost?,Permanently frozen ground.
How does climate change affect ecosystems?,Alters species distribution and nutrient cycles.
What is carbon cycling?,Movement of carbon between atmosphere biosphere and lithosphere.
What is photosynthesis?,Process by which plants convert sunlight into energy.
What is respiration?,Release of energy from food in organisms.
What is decomposition?,Breakdown of dead matter releasing nutrients.
What is evapotranspiration?,Combined evaporation and plant transpiration.
What is an ecotone?,Transition zone between two ecosystems.
What is overgrazing?,Excessive grazing reducing vegetation cover.
What is desertification?,Land degradation in arid areas.
What is conservation?,Protection and management of ecosystems.
What is a biosphere reserve?,Area protected for conservation and research.
What is ecosystem services?,Benefits humans gain from ecosystems.
Give examples of ecosystem services.,Food water climate regulation and recreation.
What exam skill is key in ecosystem essays?,Linking processes stores and flows with evaluation.
