What are the main water stores?,Oceans atmosphere ice soil groundwater and rivers.
What is evaporation?,Liquid water changing into water vapour.
What is transpiration?,Water vapour released from plants.
What is evapotranspiration?,Combined evaporation and transpiration.
What is condensation?,Water vapour cooling to form clouds.
What is precipitation?,Water falling from clouds as rain snow or hail.
What is infiltration?,Water soaking into the soil.
What is percolation?,Water moving deeper into soil and rock layers.
What is surface runoff?,Water flowing over land into rivers.
What is throughflow?,Water moving laterally through soil.
What is groundwater flow?,Water moving through rock beneath the surface.
What is a drainage basin?,Area drained by a river and its tributaries.
What is a watershed?,The boundary between drainage basins.
What is a storm hydrograph?,A graph showing river discharge over time after rainfall.
What is lag time?,Time between peak rainfall and peak discharge.
What factors affect lag time?,Soil type vegetation slope and urbanisation.
How does urbanisation affect the water cycle?,Increases runoff and flood risk.
What is carbon cycling?,Movement of carbon between atmosphere biosphere oceans and lithosphere.

What is the long-term carbon cycle?,Slow exchange involving rocks fossil fuels and tectonics.
What is ocean acidification?,Lowering of ocean pH due to dissolved carbon dioxide.
How does deforestation affect carbon cycle?,Reduces carbon storage and increases emissions.
What is a carbon sink?,A store that absorbs more carbon than it releases.
What is a carbon source?,A store that releases more carbon than it absorbs.
What is feedback in climate systems?,A process that amplifies or reduces change.
What is positive feedback?,A process that increases the effect of change.
Give an example of positive carbon feedback.,Melting permafrost releasing methane.
What is negative feedback?,A process that reduces the effect of change.
How does climate change affect the water cycle?,Increases evaporation and extreme rainfall.
What is cryosphere?,Frozen water including glaciers and ice sheets.
