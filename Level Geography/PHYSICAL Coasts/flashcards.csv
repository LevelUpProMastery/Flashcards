What is a coastline?,The boundary between land and sea.
What is a sediment cell?,A stretch of coastline where sediment is largely self-contained.
Name the main coastal processes.,Erosion transportation and deposition.
What is hydraulic action?,Erosion caused by the force of waves compressing air in cracks.
What is abrasion?,Erosion caused by rock fragments scraping the cliff.
What is attrition?,Rock fragments colliding and becoming smaller and smoother.
What is solution?,Chemical erosion where rock is dissolved.
What is longshore drift?,Movement of sediment along the coast by waves at an angle.
What is swash?,Water moving up the beach after a wave breaks.
What is backwash?,Water flowing back down the beach under gravity.
What is a constructive wave?,A low energy wave that deposits material.

What is a cliff?,A steep rock face formed by erosion.
What is a wave-cut notch?,An indentation at the base of a cliff caused by erosion.
How is a wave-cut platform formed?,Retreating cliff leaves a flat rock surface.
How is a cave formed?,Erosion widens cracks in headlands.
How is an arch formed?,Cave erodes through a headland.
How is a stack formed?,Collapse of an arch leaving a pillar of rock.
How is a stump formed?,Erosion reduces a stack to a low remnant.
What is a headland?,A resistant rock projecting into the sea.
What is a bay?,A less resistant area eroded faster forming a curved inlet.
What is a concordant coastline?,Rock layers run parallel to the coast.
What is a discordant coastline?,Rock layers run perpendicular to the coast.
What is a beach?,Accumulation of sand or shingle along the coast.
What is a spit?,A ridge of sand extending into the sea.
How is a spit formed?,Longshore drift deposits sediment beyond a bend.
