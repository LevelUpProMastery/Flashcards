What is a hazard?,A natural event that threatens people or property.
What is a disaster?,A hazard causing significant damage loss of life and disruption.
What is vulnerability?,The degree to which people are at risk from hazards.
What is risk?,The probability of a hazard occurring multiplied by its impact.
What is the disaster risk equation?,Risk = Hazard x Exposure x Vulnerability.
What is tectonic hazard?,Hazards caused by movement of tectonic plates.
What are the main types of plate boundary?,Constructive destructive conservative and collision.
What happens at a constructive boundary?,Plates move apart creating new crust.
What happens at a destructive boundary?,One plate subducts beneath another.
What happens at a conservative boundary?,Plates slide past each other.
What happens at a collision boundary?,Two continental plates collide forming mountains.
What causes earthquakes?,Sudden release of energy along faults.
What is the focus of an earthquake?,The point underground where energy is released.
What is the epicentre?,The point on the surface directly above the focus.
What is a tsunami?,A large sea wave caused by underwater disturbance.
What is a volcano?,An opening in the Earth’s crust releasing magma.
What is magma?,Molten rock beneath the Earth's surface.
What is lava?,Molten rock on the Earth’s surface.
What are primary hazards?,Immediate effects such as ground shaking.
What are secondary hazards?,Indirect effects such as landslides and fires.
What is the Richter scale?,Measures earthquake magnitude.
What is the Mercalli scale?,Measures earthquake intensity based on damage.
What is a tropical storm?,A rotating low-pressure weather system over warm oceans.
What conditions are needed for tropical storms?,Sea temperatures above 27°C low wind shear and Coriolis effect.
What is storm surge?,Rise in sea level due to low pressure and wind.
What is climate change?,Long-term change in global climate patterns.
How does climate change affect hazards?,Increases frequency and intensity of extreme weather.

What is resilience?,Ability to recover quickly from hazard events.
Why are LICs more vulnerable to hazards?,Limited infrastructure and resources.
What is the Park Model?,Shows how quality of life changes after a hazard.
What is the hazard management cycle?,Framework for managing hazards before during and after events.
What is a multi-hazard zone?,Area at risk from multiple hazard types.
What is liquefaction?,When saturated ground behaves like liquid during shaking.
What is a supervolcano?,A volcano capable of producing extremely large eruptions.
What is the Coriolis effect?,The deflection of moving air due to Earth's rotation.
Why do tropical storms weaken over land?,Loss of warm ocean energy source.
What is economic vulnerability?,Risk due to poverty and limited resources.
What is social vulnerability?,Risk due to age disability or inequality.
What is hazard perception?,How people interpret and respond to risk.
How does urbanisation increase hazard risk?,High population density and poor planning.
What is sustainable hazard management?,Balancing economic social and environmental needs.
